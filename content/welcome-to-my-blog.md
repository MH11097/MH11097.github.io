# Welcome to My Tech Blog!

Hello and welcome to my new tech blog! I'm excited to share this space with you where I'll be writing about programming, technology, and my development journey.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a place where I share:

- **Technical tutorials** and how-to guides
- **Code examples** and best practices  
- **Technology reviews** and comparisons
- **Learning experiences** from my projects
- **Industry insights** and trends

## About the Blog Technology

This blog is built using **Ristretto.rs**, an opinionated static site generator written in Rust. Some cool features:

- Fast static site generation
- Markdown-based content authoring
- Built-in RSS feed generation
- Live preview server for development
- Clean, responsive design

## Getting Started

The blog is powered by a simple workflow:

1. Write posts in Markdown format
2. Add metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
3. Generate the static site with the Rust generator
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
